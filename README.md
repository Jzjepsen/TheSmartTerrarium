# First steps
Creating a script and running it. 
This script fakes some numbers, later to be changed to seem like analogous numbers, temperature and humidity only changing +/-1 at a time. 

## Step-by-step
First go into the repo:
`cd <project_directory>`

intall packages:
`npm install`

compile typescript to javascript
`tsc`

run file:
`node dataGenerator.js`
